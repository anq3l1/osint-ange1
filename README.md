# osint-ange1

This is a very simple tool for OSINT-searching data about a person by his nickname.
The project is not yet fully finished, in the future I will finish it and add different features.

# how to use this tool?
In the line `"* Enter the user of the person you want to scan:"` enter the desired username of the person you want to find, press the Enter key, and the script will start searching, after the search is complete the script will offer you links to sites where this username was found, after which you will be asked to search again with the `'a'` key, or exit with the `'e'` key, or get more information taken from these social networks/sites with the `'i'` key.
